# FinalProject
The idea I have is to look at the amounts raised by Senatorial candidates in Missouri, including a breakdown of what has been raised and spent by Democrat and the Republican candidates. Apart from that, the report will also focus on the amount of cash in hand that candidates have at present, including analysis for some of the candidates of where they got their funds from (in-state, out of state and other notable contributors like specific industries or educational institutions, etc), trends in raising funds and try to make sense of the same. I also noticed that Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt received a lot of funds even though they are not running, so there would be a separate section for them, as well as for those like Vicky Hartzler and Cori Bush who are former House representatives running for the Senate. Also, a look at the amounts raised/spent for this election cycle in comparison to previous years from a “where we stand now” angle since it is so early in the cycle. Comments/quotes from specific lawmakers and experts well acquainted with the subject matter will be included as and when accessible or necessary.

It is also my intention to grate visual elements like a bar graph or column chart listing out the candidates that have raised the highest amounts of money, as well as what each candidate has in terms of funds raised and current cash on hand.
