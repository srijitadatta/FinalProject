# FinalProject

I intend to work on a data driven story which will involve the use of R for analysis, with possible publication in the Missourian. I would like to use this story for my graduate requirement in the state government reporting class as well, so the topic has to be related to politics or the state government. At a very skeletal level now, but here is a possible story idea: A Senate bill that will shield the Kansas City Police Department from budget cuts is currently in the committee. If passed into effect, the minimum threshold for police funding in Kansas City would be increased to 25% from the current state law budget of 20%. I would like to take a look at the biggest police departments in Missouri, their budget, how much office officers are paid in each department and do a comparison with Kansas City and statewide. Based on the data found, I would try to answer why and how there are discrepancies between police pay. It would involve a number of public records requests, and I also intend to include visualizations if possible.
